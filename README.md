## TCHack Description
Imaging the facebook or wechat account of your freinds or family are stealed by a bad guy, when the bad guy pretend to be your friend or family and send your a link, will you open it? If they are your real friends, they see some surpsing news, do not try to find it is true or not and share to you, will you share to others? Recently, Facebook really had a headache about the fake news. I am integrating with Hyphenate APIs and Google APIs to detect several information-stealing scenarios when in-app chatting
1. Detect url safe or not based on google safe browsing API, it prevent user to open malicious websites
2. Detect fake news base on google search API, it useful to prevent users to spread fake news accross the internet
3. Detect money cheating, especially someone steal your account and borrow money from your friends or family
